## Introduction
The Company Database Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to efficiently manage employee data within the company. Leveraging JavaScript, PHP, HTML/CSS, Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars, and MySQL, this system offers a scalable relational database and a dynamic web application for seamless data visualization and analysis.

## Description
The Company Database Management System is built upon a robust PHP-driven MySQL database, providing a scalable and efficient solution for storing and managing employee data. The system includes a dynamic web application connected to a REST API, allowing users to interact with the database seamlessly. Users can perform operations such as creating, removing, updating, and deleting records through an intuitive user interface, optimizing data oversight and management processes.

## Key Components
- **Relational Database:** Developed a scalable MySQL database using PHP for efficient storage and management of employee data.
- **Dynamic Web Application:** Implemented a web application connected to a REST API for data visualization and analysis.
- **User Interface Operations:** Optimized user data oversight by integrating create, remove, update, and delete operations into the user interface.

## Database Elements Used
- **Relational Database Design:** Utilized relational database principles to structure employee data efficiently, ensuring data integrity and scalability.
- **Database Operations:** Implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to allow users to interact with the database seamlessly.
- **REST API Integration:** Connected the web application to a RESTful API to facilitate data retrieval and manipulation from the database.
- **Data Visualization:** Implemented features to visualize and analyze employee data effectively within the web application.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript:** For client-side scripting and interaction.
- **PHP:** For server-side scripting and database operations.
- **HTML/CSS:** For designing the user interface and styling web pages.
- **Node.js:** For server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js:** For building web applications and RESTful APIs.
- **Handlebars:** For templating and rendering HTML pages.
- **MySQL:** For the relational database management system.
